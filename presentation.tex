\subsection{Graph Theory}
\begin{frame}{What is a graph?}
    This is an unofficial template for Florida State Mathematics poster presentation prepared by Rafiq 
    Islam\cite{fsumathposter25}. Here is how you use plain text. Here is how you can use a block to write some important information \cite{fsubeamerpresent25}
    \begin{block}{Graph Theory}
        Spectral graph theory studies properties of a graph in relationship to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices associated with the graph, such as the adjacency matrix $A$, degree matrix $D$, and Laplacian $L = D - A$.
    \end{block}
   \begin{itemize}
    \item This is how you can start \texttt{itemize}
    \item Instead of this right-pointed arrow, if you want bullets, then see the instruction in line 6

\subsection{Why Graph Theory}
\begin{frame}{Why do we need this?}
This is an unofficial template for the Florida State Mathematics poster presentation prepared by Rafiq Islam\footnote{An example of footnote}. Here is how you use plain text. Spectral graph theory studies properties of a graph in relationship to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices associated with the graph, such as the adjacency matrix $A$, degree matrix $D$, and Laplacian $L = D - A$.

\section{Methodology}
\begin{frame}{Mathematical Background}
    This section has three slides. So in the top right, we see 3 dots. Highlighted one indicates the current slide.\\
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. The Laplacian matrix is given by
        \[
        L_{ij} =
        \begin{cases}
        \deg(v_i) & \text{if } i = j, \\
        -1 & \text{if } i \neq j \text{ and } (i,j) \in E, \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}.
        \end{cases}
        \]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The eigenvalues of $L$ reveal key structural properties such as connectivity.
    \end{enumerate}
